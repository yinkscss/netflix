    <li class="list"><p class="free">Wednesday Season 2:</p> Wednesday is expelled from her high school for attempted murder. 
        She tried to kill her brother Pugsley’s bullies by throwing live piranhas into their pool. 
        She is sent to her parent’s old school, Nevermore Academy, a place for outcasts. The Principal accepts her late entry due to good grades and the family’s history at the school. Roommate Enid shows Wednesday around the school, introducing her to all the cliques. Gomez tasks Thing (the sentient hand) with spying on Wednesday in secret, but she soon finds the handy sidekick. Sheriff Galpin hunts down a serial killer or monster that is targeting hikers in the area. Wednesday falls out with popular kid Bianca and new therapist Dr. Kinbott. Xavier saves her from death. Wednesday befriends townie Tyler (the Sheriff’s son) and asks him to help her escape from Nevermore. She has a psychic vision that Rowan is in danger, 
        although he tries to kill her instead, believing her to be pure evil, 
        as depicted in an old drawing. Then the monster kills Rowan.</li>

        <li class="free" draggable="true">Secret Society</li>

    <p>Celess (Reyna Love) and Tina (Erica Pinkett) play the game too well to be considered your average gold diggers. And they're winning too. But when the jaw-dropping secret they both share is exposed, the same shovel that got them out of the dirt could very well bury them.


        We’ve seen gold diggers, but we haven’t seen them like this. Celess and Tina are women who have been stepped on ever since they were kids, but the time has come to take something back from everything that was stripped away from them. Secret Society, the energetic drama from Jamal Hill based on the novel of the same name by Miasha Coleman, spins comedy and thriller into a crazy, boozey piece that explores the highs and lows of playing the game.
        
        
        In an “eat or be eaten” world, the two women discover who they are inside themselves and beside each other, through creating a way of life that works for them. Though Secret Society boasts an exciting story with potential for great use of serious themes, its clunky structure and presentation displays cracks and becomes a bit of a bore. The performances from Love and Pinkett are great and show a decent amount of depth, but the way scenes are captured and edited create some form of disconnect. With choppy music cut-ins and quick scene changes, it’s unfortunately giving the impression of a rushed job that could do with some polishing.
